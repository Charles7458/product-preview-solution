## My process
    I built the desktop
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript


### What I learned

I learnt to use Javascript to do actions according to different media screens.
I learnt how to use sass. I used sass to write the css.

### Continued development

I coded faster this time. Javascript is tough and easily gets messy, so have to work on it.
